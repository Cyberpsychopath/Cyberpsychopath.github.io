					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>For my interest in IT I may say is for VR technology, it is started when I was in 10th grade, I played Playstation a lot, and I noticed that a game I play called “Resident Evil 7: Biohazard” has a VR version! I bought a PS VR and try it, it makes me first time feeling I am actually in this game, though I forgot to take off it before I sleep, it was a nightmare, but still, the experience that I got shocked me for a long time. I was first going to British for my Uni class, but somehow for some personal issue, I decided start my new page in Melbourne! Lots of my friends are saying Here is a nice place. I first got so interested in the Game programming class in RMIT. But after I finished my Foundation class, I was told that this course is shut down, but it doesn’t end my passion in VR. So I decided to continue improve myself in IT course. And I am so excited to learn more about how to create a better experience for user in this area.</p>

					<h2>VR developer</h2>
					<img src="VR.jpg" alt="Trulli" width="200" height="100">
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>A VR developer creates completely new digital environments that people can see through a device such as the Oculus headset, while an AR developer creates a layer of digital experience in our reality through the use of mobile apps, such as Pokemon Go, a game that utilizes this technology. </p>
					<h3>Skills I have</h3>
					<p>The skill I have right now is mostly the Indomitable attitude. I can keep working in a unsolved question untill it is done. </p>
					<h3>Skills I Need</h3>
					<p>I think as a programmer, The requirements of VR for software development are high quality skills, so know how to fluently using the C/C++ language is very basic, and it requires a relatively strong mathematical skills, too. Whats more, Passion and efficiency is important too, for example, the development period of a VR game usually cost years. So if you can not keep deep working in this area. It can slow down all the part in a develop team, so knowing how to communicate and unite with your teammates is what this job needed. 


					</p>
					<h3>Learning Plan</h3>
					<p>To become a VR developer, what I do not have and must be learned fast is the ability to use C/C++ language. It can be develop while having school class and also others online/face-to-face tutorial. Next is learning how to use game develop engine, such as U3D and UE4. </p>

				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>I am highly interested in cooking area, but in my experience, it cost me so much to buy material to try new recipe. So why can’t we just made a VR cooking training. User can cost zero to try as many recipe as they want and also don’t need to clean the kitchen. We can also set up a tutorial part(a virtual chef that can lead the user to learn how to cook step by step). Compare with attending the real cooking class. it cost less(only the VR equipment and the software).</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>Through my journey in learning cooking, I made lots of mistakes and cost a lot. Avoiding more people get start in my same situation and giving more opportunity for people to learn anywhere and anytime they want.</p>

					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>My software is a VR cooking learning tool. It is designed to fit all types of VR equipment so that people don’t need to buy a specific equipment(Playstation). And the software UI needs to be easy to get used to it, less option, more freedom for user to use(what we can do in real life kitchen it should can be done in the software).
						When user first get into this software, it will have a tutorial for user to learn how to use the virtual kitchen. The interact of the virtual tool will be designed high freedom of motion. For example the virtual oven, user needs to open the door than pull the hotplate out, switch the button to control the temperature. For the refrigerator, when user put things inside it, it will take the real life time to cool it, and if you put the food for a long time it will also rot and the system will notice the user that this material can not longer to be used.
						When user choose a recipe to do, it will first giving a material list for user to collect. Then showing up the step that user should follow, first chop the food, than cook it, season it,etc.
